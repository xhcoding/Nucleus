QuickStart
====

QuickStart is meant to be exactly that, a Sponge plugin that allows you to quickly start your server with essential commands, events, and other tidbits that you might need. 
Extremely configurable, only loading up the modules you want (and providing a way for plugins to disable modules that they replace the functionality of), and providing a simple and rich API, 
QuickStart is an elite plugin for providing simple server tasks.
 
...or so I hope, soon! With a website full of documentation and everything (at http://quickstart.dualspiral.co.uk/)! I'm only just getting this off the ground as Sponge has started to stabilise!

QuickStart currently provides:

* Warps
* Homes
* Teleports (needs to be tested!)
* Kicks
* Bans
* Jails
* Mutes
* Messages
* Mails
* Seen
* Time
* Weather
* Broadcasts
* Fly
* Healing and Feeding
* AFK

...some of which have the ability for warmups and cooldowns to take place, as well as charging users.

The suggested permissionsets are `quickstart.admin`, `quickstart.mod` and `quickstart.user`. More detailed documentation will appear soon.

All code is available under the MIT licence. Contributions are welcome.
