+------------------------------------------------------------+

config.chat.modify=If "true", Nucleus will attempt to modify the chat
config.chat.template.namecolour=The default colour for a player''s name if the "namecolour" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "chatcolour" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no change of colour). Do not include the "&" character.
config.chat.template.namestyle=The default styles for a player''s name if the "namestyle" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes \
  the same input as the "namestyle" option, set to "" to retain default behaviour (no style). Do not include the "&" character. Multiple styles \
  must be separated by commas.
config.chat.template.chatcolour=The default colour for a player''s chat if the "chatcolour" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "namecolour" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no change of colour). Do not include the "&" character.
config.chat.template.chatstyle=The default styles for a player''s chat if the "chatstyle" permission option isn''t set on the player or group. Takes the same input as the "chatstyle" option \
set to "" to retain default behaviour (no style). Do not include the "&" character. Multiple styles must be separated by commas.
config.chat.template.prefix='Sets the prefix to a message. {{prefix}} - prefix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{suffix}} - suffix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{name}} - real name, {{displayname}} - display name'
config.chat.template.suffix='Sets the suffix to a message. {{prefix}} - prefix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{suffix}} - suffix (set as an option in a permission plugin), {{name}} - real name, {{displayname}} - display name'
config.chat.default-template=The default chat template if no group templates apply.
config.chat.group-templates=Group templates override the default chat template based on the users group. Note that the group name is case sensitive.\n\
Weight matters, the player will use the highest weighted template in this list that matches a group they are in, including inherited groups. If the same weight \
is used on two or more entries, the group with the most parents will be used.
config.chat.weight=The weight of the template. A higher number will take priority over lower numbers when two templates could apply to the same player because \
they are in the both groups.
config.chat.useGroupTemplates=If "true", then Nucleus will select the most appropriate group template for a player when they send a chat message. If it''s false \n\
the default template will always be used, but there will be a performance gain because a player''s groups not not have to be retrieved from the permission plugin. \n\
Turn this off if you are getting severe performance problems when someone chats, it''s usually due to a misbehaving permissions plugin.
config.chat.check-permission-groups=If true, Nucleus will select the most appropriate group template for a player when they send a chat message by \
  checking all of the groups that a player has if the player does not have the "nucleus.chat.group" permission option set. If false, Nucleus will \
  only look for the "nucleus.chat.group" option on players when they chat and will match that to the available group templates, if no match, \
  Nucleus will apply the default template without checking actual permission groups. \n\n\
  If your chat is lagging and you have group templates turned on, try setting this to false and giving your groups the appropriate \
  "nucleus.chat.group" permission option.
config.chat.main=If true, Nucleus will take the message and try to apply it''s own transforms to it. This may overwrite other plugins who do processing super early, so turn this off if you are having problems.
config.chat.includeprefix=If false, Nucleus will prepend it''s prefixes/headers with those already set buy other plugins. If true, it will \
  overwrite them.
config.chat.includesuffix=If false, Nucleus will prepend it''s suffixes/footers with those already set buy other plugins. If true, it will \
  overwrite them.
config.chat.meprefix=The prefix to use when someone uses "/me".
config.chat.checkbody=Some mods and plugins move the Minecraft player prefix to the main message body. If this is the case, turn this on, and Nucleus \n\
  will try to remove it.

config.home.safeTeleport=If true, Nucleus will attempt to ensure that users do not get warped into an unsafe situation (for example, if someone breaks blocks around a home).
config.home.respawnAtHome=If true, on respawn, a player will spawn back at their default home (named "home") if it exists.
